        Clustering is widely used in unsupervised learning method that deals with unlabeled data. Deep clustering has become a popular study area that relates clustering with Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture. Deep clustering method downsamples high dimensional data, which may also relate clustering loss. Deep clustering is also introduced in semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most SSL methods depend on pairwise constraint information, which is a matrix containing knowledge if data pairs can be in the same cluster or not. This paper introduces a novel embedding system named AutoEmbedder, that downsamples higher dimensional data to clusterable embedding points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research endeavor that relates to traditional classifier DNN architecture with a pairwise loss reduction technique. The training process is semi-supervised and uses Siamese network architecture to compute pairwise constraint loss in the feature learning phase. The AutoEmbedder outperforms most of the existing DNN based semi-supervised methods tested on famous datasets.

        Pandemic defines the global outbreak of a disease having a high transmission rate. The impact of a pandemic situation can be lessened by restricting the movement of the mass. However, one of its concomitant circumstances is an economic crisis. In this article, we demonstrate what actions an agent (trained using reinforcement learning) may take in different possible scenarios of a pandemic depending on the spread of disease and economic factors. To train the agent, we design a virtual pandemic scenario closely related to the present COVID-19 crisis. Then, we apply reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that deals with how an individual (human/machine) should interact on an environment (real/virtual) to achieve the cherished goal. Finally, we demonstrate what optimal actions the agent perform to reduce the spread of disease while considering the economic factors. In our experiment, we let the agent find an optimal solution without providing any prior knowledge. After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent’s performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease. The estimation and policy of the agent may improve the human-strategy of placing lockdown so that an economic crisis may be avoided while mitigating an infectious disease.

        Fabric is a planar material composed of textile fibers. Textile fibers are generated from many natural sources; including plants, animals, minerals, and even, it can be synthetic. A particular fabric may contain different types of fibers that pass through a complex production process. Fiber identification is usually carried out through chemical tests and microscopic tests. However, these testing processes are complicated as well as time-consuming. We propose FabricNet, a pioneering approach for the image-based textile fiber recognition system, which may have a revolutionary impact from individual to the industrial fiber recognition process. The FabricNet can recognize a large scale of fibers by only utilizing a surface image of fabric. The recognition system is constructed using a distinct category of class-based ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The experiment is conducted on recognizing 50 different types of textile fibers. This experiment includes a significantly large number of unique textile fibers than previous research endeavors to the best of our knowledge. We experiment with popular CNN architectures that include Inception, ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, DenseNet, and Xception. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that FabricNet outperforms the state-of-the-art popular CNN architectures by reaching an accuracy of 84% and F1-score of 90%.

        Speaker recognition is related to human biometrics dealing with the identification of speakers from their speech. Speaker recognition is an active research area and being widely investigated using artificially intelligent mechanisms. Though speaker recognition systems were previously constructed using handcrafted statistical means of machine learning, currently it is being shifted to state-of-the-art deep learning strategies. Further, deep learning being a fast-paced domain, an absence of comprehensive survey is observed in the current deep speaker recognition technologies. In this paper, we focus on deep speaker recognition technologies. The paper particularly introduces a taxonomy, explains the progress, architectural strategies and processes of some distinctive approaches. Further, the manuscript classifies and enlists the currently available datasets and programming tools. Finally, the paper investigates the challenges and future directives of deep speaker recognition technology.

        Speech recognition is a fascinating process that offers the opportunity to interact and command the machine in the field of human-computer interactions. Speech recognition is a language-dependent system constructed directly based on the linguistic and textual properties of any language. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are currently being used to translate speech to text flawlessly. Although ASR systems are being strongly executed in international languages, ASR systems' implementation in the Bengali language has not reached an acceptable state. In this research work, we sedulously disclose the current status of the Bengali ASR system's research endeavors. In what follows, we acquaint the challenges that are mostly encountered while constructing a Bengali ASR system. We split the challenges into language-dependent and language-independent challenges and guide how the particular complications may be overhauled. Following a rigorous investigation and highlighting the challenges, we conclude that Bengali ASR systems require specific construction of ASR architectures based on the Bengali language's grammatical and phonetic structure.

        Speaker recognition deals with recognizing speakers by their speech. Most speaker recognition systems are built upon two stages, the first stage extracts low dimensional correlation embeddings from speech, and the second performs the classification task. The robustness of a speaker recognition system mainly depends on the extraction process of speech embeddings, which are primarily pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. As the embedding systems are pre-trained, the performance of speaker recognition models greatly depends on domain adaptation policy, which may reduce if trained using inadequate data. This paper introduces a speaker recognition strategy dealing with unlabeled data, which generates clusterable embedding vectors from small fixed-size speech frames. The unsupervised training strategy involves an assumption that a small speech segment should include a single speaker. Depending on such a belief, a pairwise constraint is constructed with noise augmentation policies, used to train AutoEmbedder architecture that generates speaker embeddings. Without relying on domain adaption policy, the process unsupervisely produces clusterable speaker embeddings, termed unsupervised vectors (u-vectors). The evaluation is concluded in two popular speaker recognition datasets for English language, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech. Also, a Bengali dataset is included to illustrate the diversity of the domain shifts for speaker recognition systems. Finally, we conclude that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory performance using pairwise architectures.

        Writer identification is the procedure of identifying individuals from handwriting. Writer identification is a common interest in biometric authentication and verification systems, and numerous studies are available for English, Chinese, Arabic, and Persian specific handwriting. This paper introduces a supervised offline Indic script writer identification system that can identify individuals using less than a single page of handwriting. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture fused with non-trainable Gabor filters is used as an identification model that can recognize writers from scarce data. For the experiment, we used BanglaWriting dataset, which is openly available for Bengali writing and writer recognition. Further, we added Devanagari and Telugu datasets for evaluation. The overall evaluation shows that the proposed thresholded Gabor-based CNN architecture performs superior to numerous deep CNN architectures for Indic writer recognition.

    <div id="fruitdet" class="abstract"><p>
        Computer vision is currently experiencing success in various domains due to the harnessing of deep learning strategies. In the case of precision agriculture, computer vision is being investigated for detecting fruits from orchards. However, such strategies limit too-high complexity computation that is impossible to embed in an automated device. Nevertheless, most investigation of fruit detection is limited to a single fruit, resulting in the necessity of a one-to-many object detection system. This paper introduces a generic detection mechanism named FruitDet, designed to be prominent for detecting fruits. The FruitDet architecture is designed on the YOLO pipeline and achieves better performance in detecting fruits than any other detection model. The backbone of the detection model is implemented using DenseNet architecture. Further, the FruitDet is packed with newer concepts: attentive pooling, bottleneck spatial pyramid pooling, and blackout mechanism. The detection mechanism is benchmarked using five datasets, which combines a total of eight different fruit classes. The FruitDet architecture acquires better performance than any other recognized detection methods in fruit detection.

        Breast cancer is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, and its percentage is gradually increasing. Optimistically, there is a good chance of recovery from breast cancer if identified and treated at an early stage. Therefore, several researchers have established deep-learning-based automated methods for their efficiency and accuracy in predicting the growth of cancer cells utilizing medical imaging modalities. As of yet, few review studies on breast cancer diagnosis are available that summarize some existing studies. However, these studies were unable to address emerging architectures and modalities in breast cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on the evolving architectures of deep learning for breast cancer detection. In what follows, this survey presents existing deep-learning-based architectures, analyzes the strengths and limitations of the existing studies, examines the used datasets, and reviews image pre-processing techniques. Furthermore, a concrete review of diverse imaging modalities, performance metrics and results, challenges, and research directions for future researchers is presented.

        Humans can identify a speaker by listening to their voice, over the telephone, or on any digital devices. Acquiring this congenital human competency, authentication technologies based on voice biometrics, such as automatic speaker recognition (ASR), have been introduced. An ASR recognizes speakers by analyzing speech signals and characteristics extracted from speaker’s voices. ASR has recently become an effective research area as an essential aspect of voice biometrics. Specifically, this literature survey gives a concise introduction to ASR and provides an overview of the general architectures dealing with speaker recognition technologies, and upholds the past, present, and future research trends in this area. This paper briefly describes all the main aspects of ASR, such as speaker identification, verification, diarization etc. Further, the performance of current speaker recognition systems are investigated in this survey with the limitations and possible ways of improvement. Finally, a few unsolved challenges of speaker recognition are presented at the closure of this survey.

        Speaker recognition is an active research area that contains notable usage in biometric security and authentication system. Currently, there exist many well-performing models in the speaker recognition domain. However, most of the advanced models implement deep learning that requires GPU support for real-time speech recognition, and it is not suitable for low-end devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight text-independent speaker recognition model based on random forest classifier. It also introduces new features that are used for both speaker verification and identification tasks. The proposed model uses human speech based timbral properties as features that are classified using random forest. Timbre refers to the very basic properties of sound that allow listeners to discriminate among them. The prototype uses seven most actively searched timbre properties, boominess, brightness, depth, hardness, roughness, sharpness, and warmth as features of our speaker recognition model. The experiment is carried out on speaker verification and speaker identification tasks and shows the achievements and drawbacks of the proposed model. In the speaker identification phase, it achieves a maximum accuracy of 78%. On the contrary, in the speaker verification phase, the model maintains an accuracy of 80% having an equal error rate (ERR) of 0.24.

        No doubt, the COVID-19 outbreak exemplifies ongoing biothreats to humanity as a whole. This necessitates an emergency response towards its remedy because it is heightened in importance and compressed in the time frame. Consequently, significant research efforts have been noticed to tackle this pressing crisis. In this paper, we endeavor to formulate a mathematical model of the transmission of COVID-19. The dynamics of the disease are illustrated by a compartmental model that involves differential equations. The paper also exhibits a mathematical estimation of the future threats induced by COVID-19 universally, which is computed based on the immediate statistical data. We compute the current transmission rate of COVID-19 to be 0.0462, considering the current fertility and mortality of the world population. From the threat estimation, it is expected that the COVID-19 may eliminate around 30% of the current population by the next three years, and it may obliterate nearly 43% of the current population by the next five years.

        In the field of natural language processing and human-computer interaction, human attitudes and sentiments have attracted the researchers. However, in the field of human-computer interaction, human abnormality detection has not been investigated extensively and most works depend on image-based information. In natural language processing, effective meaning can potentially convey by all words. Each word may bring out difficult encounters because of their semantic connection with ideas or categories. In this paper, an efficient and effective human abnormality detection model is introduced, that only uses Bengali text. This proposed model can recognize whether the person is in a normal or abnormal state by analyzing their typed Bengali text. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in developing a text based human abnormality detection system. We have created our Bengali dataset (contains 2000 sentences) that is generated by voluntary conversations. We have performed the comparative analysis by using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine as classifiers. Two different feature extraction techniques count vector, and TF-IDF is used to experiment on our constructed dataset. We have achieved a maximum 89% accuracy and 92% F1-score with our constructed dataset in our experiment.

        Object classification is a significant task in computer vision. It has become an effective research area as an important aspect of image processing and the building block of image localization, detection, and scene parsing. Object classification from low-quality images is difficult for the variance of object colors, aspect ratios, and cluttered backgrounds. The field of object classification has seen remarkable advancements, with the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Deep neural networks have been demonstrated as very powerful systems for facing the challenge of object classification from high-resolution images, but deploying such object classification networks on the embedded device remains challenging due to the high computational and memory requirements. Using high-quality images often causes high computational and memory complexity, whereas low-quality images can solve this issue. Hence, in this paper, we investigate an optimal architecture that accurately classifies low-quality images using DCNNs architectures. To validate different baselines on lowquality images, we perform experiments using webcam captured image datasets of 10 different objects. In this research work, we evaluate the proposed architecture by implementing popular CNN architectures. The experimental results validate that the MobileNet architecture delivers better than most of the available CNN architectures for low-resolution webcam image datasets.

        Optical character recognition (OCR) is a process of converting analogue documents into digital using document images. Currently, many commercial and non-commercial OCR systems exist for both handwritten and printed copies for different languages. Despite this, very few works are available in case of recognising Bengali words. Among them, most of the works focused on OCR of printed Bengali characters. This paper introduces an end-to-end OCR system for Bengali language. The proposed architecture implements an end to end strategy that recognises handwritten Bengali words from handwritten word images. We experiment with popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including DenseNet, Xception, NASNet, and MobileNet to build the OCR architecture. Further, we experiment with two different recurrent neural networks (RNN) methods, LSTM and GRU. We evaluate the proposed architecture using BanglaWritting dataset, which is a peer-reviewed Bengali handwritten image dataset. The proposed method achieves 0.091 character error rate and 0.273 word error rate performed using DenseNet121 model with GRU recurrent layer.

    <div id="allplantdisease" class="abstract"><p>
        A disease that limits a plant from its maximal capacity is defined as plant disease. From the perspective of agriculture, diagnosing plant disease is crucial, as diseases often limit plants' production capacity. However, manual approaches to recognize plant diseases are often temporal, challenging, and time-consuming. Therefore, computerized recognition of plant diseases is highly desired in the field of agricultural automation. Due to the recent improvement of computer vision, identifying diseases using leaf images of a particular plant has already been introduced. Nevertheless, the most introduced model can only diagnose diseases of a specific plant. Hence, in this chapter, we investigate an optimal plant disease identification model combining the diagnosis of multiple plants. Despite relying on multi-class classification, the model inherits a multilabel classification method to identify the plant and the type of disease in parallel. For the experiment and evaluation, we collected data from various online sources that included leaf images of six plants, including tomato, potato, rice, corn, grape, and apple. In our investigation, we implement numerous popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The experimental results validate that the Xception and DenseNet architectures perform better in multi-label plant disease classification tasks. Through architectural investigation, we imply that skip connections, spatial convolutions, and shorter hidden layer connectivity cause better results in plant disease classification.
